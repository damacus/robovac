## Key Changes in PR #171

### 1. Battery Deprecation (HA 2026.8 Compatibility)

- Removes `VacuumEntityFeature.BATTERY` from 35+ vacuum models
- Removes `_attr_battery_level` from vacuum entity
- **Impact:** Prepares for Home Assistant 2026.8 deprecation
- **Backward Compatibility:** Battery sensor continues to work independently

### 2. Error Message Improvements

- Fixes typo: "Laser sesor stuck" → "Laser sensor stuck"
- Adds `getErrorMessageWithContext()` function with troubleshooting guidance
- Provides actionable error context for users

### 3. Model Validation Tools

- **model_validator.py:** Library module for model validation
  - Series detection (C, G, L, X)
  - Model similarity suggestions
  - Series-specific troubleshooting
- **model_validator_cli.py:** Standalone CLI tool
  - Validate model compatibility
  - List supported models
  - Get suggestions for unsupported models

## Implementation Plan Created

A comprehensive, multi-phased implementation plan has been created:

**File:** `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PR171.md`

### Plan Structure

#### Phase 1: Battery Deprecation (Test-First)

- Write failing tests for battery feature removal
- Remove battery feature from 35 vacuum models
- Remove `_attr_battery_level` from vacuum entity
- Verify battery sensor still works

#### Phase 2: Error Message Improvements (Test-First)

- Write tests for error message enhancements
- Fix typo in error messages
- Implement `getErrorMessageWithContext()` function
- Add troubleshooting context dictionary

#### Phase 3: Model Validator Library (Test-First)

- Write comprehensive tests for model validator
- Create `model_validator.py` module
- Implement series detection
- Add model suggestion algorithm
- Provide troubleshooting guides

#### Phase 4: Model Validator CLI Tool (Test-First)

- Write tests for CLI functionality
- Create `model_validator_cli.py` tool
- Support standalone usage
- Add user-friendly output

#### Phase 5: Integration and Documentation

- Create end-to-end integration tests
- Update README, DEVELOPMENT.md, CHANGELOG.md
- Run full test suite
- Validate all quality checks pass

#### Phase 6: Review and Cleanup

- Complete code review checklist
- Create implementation summary
- Final validation

## Key Design Decisions

### TDD Approach

All phases follow strict Test-Driven Development:

1. Write failing tests first
2. Implement minimal code to pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Commit small, focused changes

### Code Quality Standards

- **Type hints:** Required on all functions
- **Docstrings:** Google style for all public functions
- **Linting:** Must pass `task lint`
- **Type checking:** Must pass `task type-check`
- **Testing:** Must pass `task test`

### Backward Compatibility

- No breaking changes for existing users
- Battery sensor continues to work via separate sensor component
- Error message function maintains existing interface
- Model validator gracefully handles import failures

---

## Success Criteria

### Must Have

- [ ] All 35 vacuum models have battery feature removed
- [ ] Error message typo fixed
- [ ] `getErrorMessageWithContext()` implemented and tested
- [ ] `model_validator.py` implemented and tested
- [ ] `model_validator_cli.py` implemented and tested
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] No type checking errors
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Should Have

- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Test coverage ≥ 90% for new code
- [ ] CLI tool tested manually
- [ ] README examples work
- [ ] Backward compatibility verified

---

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1:** Battery Deprecation - 2-3 hours
- **Phase 2:** Error Messages - 2-3 hours
- **Phase 3:** Model Validator Library - 3-4 hours
- **Phase 4:** CLI Tool - 2-3 hours
- **Phase 5:** Integration & Docs - 2-3 hours
- **Phase 6:** Review & Cleanup - 1-2 hours

**Total:** 12-18 hours of focused development

---

## Next Steps for Implementer

1. Read the full implementation plan: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PR171.md`
2. Start with Phase 1, Step 1.1 (write failing tests)
3. Follow TDD cycle strictly: Red → Green → Refactor
4. Make small, atomic commits with conventional commit messages
5. Run quality checks after each phase
6. Update this summary as phases are completed

## Files to be Created/Modified

### New Files

- `tests/test_vacuum/test_battery_feature_removal.py`
- `tests/test_errors.py`
- `tests/test_model_validator.py`
- `tests/test_model_validator_cli.py`
- `tests/test_integration_pr171.py`
- `custom_components/robovac/model_validator.py`
- `custom_components/robovac/model_validator_cli.py`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_PR171.md` (after completion)

### Modified Files

- All 35 vacuum model files in `custom_components/robovac/vacuums/T2*.py`
- `custom_components/robovac/vacuum.py`
- `custom_components/robovac/errors.py`
- `README.md`
- `DEVELOPMENT.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

## Questions to Clarify

1. Should `model_validator.py` be exposed as a public API?
2. Should CLI tool be installed system-wide or just in project?
3. Any specific Home Assistant version requirements beyond 2026.8?
4. Should we add deprecation warnings for battery feature in logs?
5. Performance requirements for model suggestion algorithm?

## Notes

- PR has already addressed flake8 errors from initial review
- Author (magicalyak) is responsive and has fixed issues quickly
- CI needs maintainer approval to run on latest commits
- All Copilot review comments have been addressed or clarified
- Plan is detailed enough for another LLM to execute independently

## Conclusion

PR #171 adds valuable features with good code quality. The implementation plan provides a comprehensive, test-first approach to replicate this functionality on the current branch while adhering to project coding standards.

**Recommendation:** Follow the detailed implementation plan in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PR171.md` to implement these features with full test coverage and quality assurance.
