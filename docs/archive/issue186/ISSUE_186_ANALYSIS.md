# Issue #186 Analysis Summary

## Quick Answer

**Is the error still present?** ‚ö†Ô∏è **YES**

The underlying problem still exists, but the symptom has changed:

- **Before:** WARNING logs flooding Home Assistant
- **Now:** DEBUG logs (less visible) + status values not translated to human-readable form
- **Root Cause:** T2262 model definition missing STATUS value mappings

## The Problem

Users with T2262 vacuum models report these status values cannot be translated:

- "Charging"
- "Sleeping"  
- "completed"

**Current T2262 Definition:**

```python
RobovacCommand.STATUS: {
    "code": 15,
},
```

Missing the `values` dictionary that maps device responses to human-readable strings.

**What Happens:**

1. Device sends status like "Charging"
2. `getRoboVacHumanReadableValue()` can't find mapping
3. Returns raw value as-is
4. Logs debug message (not visible unless debug logging enabled)
5. Home Assistant might display raw value instead of friendly status

## Why We Can't Fix It Immediately

**CRITICAL BLOCKER:** We need actual device data.

- T2262 uses STATUS code **15**
- T2277 (which has mappings) uses code **153**
- Different codes = different value encodings
- Cannot safely copy mappings between models

**Example from T2277 (code 153):**

```python
"Charging": "BBADGgA=",  # Base64-encoded
"Sleeping": "AhAB",
```

T2262's code 15 likely uses completely different values.

## Solution Path

### Step 1: Get Real Data (REQUIRED)

Contact users via issue #186 and request:

```yaml
# Enable debug logging in Home Assistant
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.robovac: debug
```

Need them to capture:

- Raw value device sends
- What Eufy app displayed
- Do this for: Charging, Sleeping, Completed, Standby, Paused, Cleaning, etc.

### Step 2: Implement Fix (TDD)

1. **Write failing test** for STATUS values
2. **Add mappings** to T2262.py
3. **Verify tests pass**
4. **User validation** on real device

### Step 3: Apply to Related Models

These models also have STATUS code 15 with no values:

- T2253 (specifically mentioned in issue)
- T2250, T2251, T2252, T2254, T2255, T2259, T2268, T2270, T2272, T2273

## Key Instructions for Next LLM

### DO NOT Proceed Until

1. ‚ùå User provides actual T2262 device data
2. ‚ùå At least 5-7 status values collected
3. ‚ùå User confirms Eufy app display for each value

### MUST Follow TDD

1. ‚úÖ Write test FIRST
2. ‚úÖ Verify test FAILS
3. ‚úÖ Implement feature
4. ‚úÖ Verify test PASSES
5. ‚úÖ Run full test suite

### DO NOT

- ‚ùå Guess at status values
- ‚ùå Copy from T2277 (different code!)
- ‚ùå Skip tests
- ‚ùå Implement without data

## Current Status

| Phase | Status | Blocker |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Data Collection | ‚è∏Ô∏è **Waiting** | Need user input |
| Implementation | ‚è∏Ô∏è Blocked | Waiting on data |
| Testing | ‚è∏Ô∏è Blocked | Waiting on implementation |
| User Validation | ‚è∏Ô∏è Blocked | Waiting on implementation |

## Next Actions

### For You (Repository Owner)

1. **Post comment on issue #186** requesting device data:

````markdown
Hi everyone! To fix this issue properly, I need actual device data from T2262 owners.

Could you please:

1. Enable debug logging in Home Assistant:

   ```yaml
   logger:
     default: info
     logs:
       custom_components.robovac: debug
   ```

1. Watch your logs and note when you see messages like:
   "Command status with value X not found for model T2262"

1. For each message, tell me:
   - The raw value (X in the message)
   - What the Eufy app showed at that exact time

Example:

- Raw value: "charging"
- Eufy app showed: "Charging"

Especially interested in these states:

- Charging
- Sleeping
- Completed/Finished
- Standby/Idle
- Paused
- Cleaning/Auto
- Returning home

Thank you! üôè

1. **Wait for user responses** with data

1. **Hand off to LLM** with collected data + `ISSUE_186_FIX_PLAN.md`

### For Next LLM

1. **Read** `ISSUE_186_FIX_PLAN.md` thoroughly
2. **Verify** you have user data
3. **Follow TDD** workflow exactly
4. **Test** with `task test`
5. **Validate** with users
