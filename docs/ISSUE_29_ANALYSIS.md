# Issue #29 Analysis: Add Support for Eufy Clean L60 (T2268)

## Issue Summary

**Issue:** [#29](https://github.com/damacus/robovac/issues/29)  
**Created:** April 14, 2025  
**Reporter:** @MartinBachmannHD  
**Request:** Add support for T2268 model (Eufy Clean L60)

## Original Problem

User reported that their L60 vacuum was discovered but not supported:

- Error message: "Model T2268 is not supported"
- User has both 15C and L60 vacuums
- L60 was being discovered but not functioning
- Reference to maximoei/robovac L60-support branch

## Current Status

### ✅ Model Implementation: COMPLETE

The T2268 model **IS implemented** in the codebase:

- **File:** `custom_components/robovac/vacuums/T2268.py`
- **Registered:** Yes, in `vacuums/__init__.py`
- **Added via:** PR #81 (documented in CHANGELOG.md)
- **Version:** Added in v1.2.3

### Model Configuration

The T2268 implementation includes:

**HomeAssistant Features:**

- CLEAN_SPOT
- FAN_SPEED
- LOCATE
- PAUSE
- RETURN_HOME
- SEND_COMMAND
- START
- STATE
- STOP
- MAP

**RoboVac Features:**

- CLEANING_TIME
- CLEANING_AREA
- DO_NOT_DISTURB
- AUTO_RETURN
- ROOM
- ZONE
- BOOST_IQ
- MAP

**Commands Implemented:**

- START_PAUSE (code: 2)
- DIRECTION (code: 3) - forward, back, left, right
- MODE (code: 5) - auto, small_room, spot, edge, nosweep
- STATUS (code: 15)
- RETURN_HOME (code: 101)
- FAN_SPEED (code: 102) - pure, standard, turbo, max
- LOCATE (code: 103)
- BATTERY (code: 104)
- ERROR (code: 106)

## Problem Identified

### ❌ Test Coverage: MISSING

Following TDD principles, T2268 lacks test coverage:

**Missing Test File:**

- `tests/test_vacuum/test_t2268_command_mappings.py` - Does not exist

**Pattern Comparison:**

Similar L-series models with test coverage:

- T2275 ✅ has `test_t2275_command_mappings.py`
- T2276 ✅ has `test_t2276_command_mappings.py`
- T2277 ✅ has `test_t2277_command_mappings.py`
- T2320 ✅ has `test_t2320_command_mappings.py`

Related models missing tests:

- T2267 (L60 Hybrid) ❌ no test file (added in same PR #81)
- T2268 (L60) ❌ no test file

## Validation Findings

### Code Search Results

```bash
# T2268 is properly registered
vacuums/__init__.py:30:from .T2268 import T2268
vacuums/__init__.py:74:    "T2268": T2268,

# Model detection works
tests/test_model_validator.py:31:# L series models: T2267, T2268, T2270...

# Used in conftest fixtures
tests/conftest.py:53:# Set up getRoboVacCommandValue to simulate T2268 model lookup behavior
```

### No Reported Issues Post-Implementation

- No GitHub issues or comments indicating T2268 is broken
- Implementation appears functional
- Issue can likely be closed once tests are added

## Compliance Gaps

### Global Rules Violations

From `user_global` memory:

> **REQUIRED: Every line of production code must be written in response to a failing test.**

**Violation:** T2268.py (76 lines) exists without corresponding test file

### Expected Test Patterns

Based on existing test files (e.g., `test_t2277_command_mappings.py`):

1. **Fixture:** `mock_t2268_robovac()`
2. **DPS Codes Test:** Verify command-to-DPS mappings
3. **Mode Command Test:** Verify mode value mappings
4. **FAN_SPEED Command Test:** Verify fan speed value mappings
5. **Direction Command Test:** Verify direction value mappings
6. **Unknown Value Test:** Verify fallback behavior

## Conclusion

**Issue Status:** Functionally resolved, but non-compliant with TDD requirements

The original user request is satisfied (T2268 support exists), but the implementation violates project TDD discipline by lacking test coverage. Both T2267 and T2268 need comprehensive test files following the established pattern.

**Recommendation:** Create test files for T2267 and T2268, then close issue #29 as resolved.
